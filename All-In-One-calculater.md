# All-In-One Calculator in C

This program is a comprehensive calculator tool implemented in C, offering multiple mathematical utilities including parameter calculations, algebraic equation solving, area calculations, unit conversions, trigonometric calculations, statistics calculations, and basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- **Parameter Calculations**  
  Calculate perimeter of various shapes like square, circle, rectangle, parallelogram, triangle, polygon, and trapezium.

- **Algebra**  
  Solve linear and quadratic equations with real or complex roots.

- **Area Calculations**  
  Compute area of multiple shapes including square, circle, rectangle, parallelogram, triangle, polygon, trapezium.

- **Unit Converter**  
  Perform conversions between Celsius-Fahrenheit, meters-feet, kilograms-pounds, hours-seconds, gallons-liters.

- **Trigonometry**  
  Calculate sin, cos, tan, cosec, sec, cot values for angles in degrees, with domain checking.

- **Statistics**  
  Calculate mean and standard deviation from a user-input dataset.

- **Basic Mathematics**  
  Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.

## How to Use

Run the compiled program, and the main menu will appear. Enter a choice number (1 to 8) to select the desired calculation type:

- 1: Parameter Calculator
- 2: Algebra Solver
- 3: Area Calculator
- 4: Unit Converter
- 5: Trigonometry Functions
- 6: Statistics Calculator
- 7: Basic Mathematics Operations
- 8: Exit the program

Follow on-screen prompts to enter required values. After each calculation, press Enter to return to the main menu.

## Code Structure

- `main()` contains the main menu loop with a switch statement routing to various functions.
- Each mathematical utility is implemented in a dedicated `void` function such as `pera_calc()`, `algebraMenu()`, `area_calc()`, `unit_conv()`, `trigno()`, `statistics()`, and `Basic_Multi()`.
- A helper function `waitForEnter()` is used to pause the console and wait for user input before returning to the menu.
- Constants like `PI` are defined for geometric calculations.
- Clear error handling and input validation is included for operations like division and trigonometric domain checks.

## Example

To calculate the area of a circle:
1. Select option 3 in the main menu.
2. Choose option 2 for "Area of Circle".
3. Enter the radius when prompted.
4. The program will display the area and wait for Enter to return to the main menu.

## Requirements

- Standard C compiler (gcc or similar)
- Compatible with Windows and Linux console environments
